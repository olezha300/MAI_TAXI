# MAI_TAXI


This project is the creation of a taxi web application based on Django for backend and JavaScript, HTML, CSS for frontend development. In the application, users will be able to register, order a taxi, view travel history, rate drivers, and administrators will be able to manage tariffs. The combination of functionality on the server and client sides will make the application convenient and intuitive for users, providing them with full control over taxi orders and personal settings.
